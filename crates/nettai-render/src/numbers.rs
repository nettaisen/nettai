//! The game's numbers in the enhanced mode: each digit (and the '+', the
//! "x" of "x2", the '?' marks) drawn in a bundled font, Bungee (fonts/bungee,
//! SIL Open Font License 1.1), at the output's resolution, fitted to the box
//! the game's own digit picture fills in its cell (the user, 2026-10-19: "i
//! like bungee"; docs/design/text-rendering.md §12.4).
//!
//! A set of the game's number glyphs (the HP box's digits, the enemies' in
//! each color, the damage digits, the chip window's, a telop's, the
//! banners') says how its numbers look: the box its faces fill in their
//! 8x16 cells, the face's colors down its rows, and its outline (a rim all
//! round, or a shadow right and down), as the pack has read them off the
//! glyphs (`nettai_assets::letters::Digits`). Each character is drawn in
//! the glyph's cell, its ink stretched to fill that box, so a number's
//! digits stand where the picture's did, each the same width: a number
//! doesn't move as it changes, and its columns line up.
